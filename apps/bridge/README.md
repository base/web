# Base Bridge Has Been Deprecated

In May 2024, the Base native bridge was deactivated.

Since its deactivation, bridge.base.org has served as a Next.js site displaying
a static page with bridging guidance. Going forward, bridge.base.org will redirect
to a new static markdown page hosted on docs.base.org. This update simplifies
maintenance and aligns with our ongoing efforts to streamline documentation.
For the latest bridging instructions, please refer to [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/chain/bridges-mainnet).

[addition] If you wish to see the Base Bridge code you can review the `base/web`
repo at commit [b3dc865225339e943a14715acf30b9b2820b3dc0](https://github.com/base/web/tree/b3dc865225339e943a14715acf30b9b2820b3dc0/apps/bridge).
