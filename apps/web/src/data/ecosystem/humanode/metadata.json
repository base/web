  "description": "Biomapper is an on-chain dapp that lets a person verify only one EVM-compatible wallet address, preventing Sybil attacks. Users simply accept terms, complete a 15-second facial scan, and sign a smart contract with a minimal fee. Unlike KYC, no personal data is shared, and Biometric data goes to a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) for private verification of uniqueness and liveness.",
