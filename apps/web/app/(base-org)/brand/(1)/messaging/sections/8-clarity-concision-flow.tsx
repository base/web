      “The goal is to make your paper as simple and clear, as immediately intelligible to the reader
      as possible. This doesn&apos;t mean that you should ignore subtle and sophisticated
      complexities in your theory - but the challenge is to state those complexities simply and
      clearly. Avoid making your subject seem more complex than necessary (for example, if something
      &quot;creates habits&quot;, it&apos;s probably neither necessary nor helpful to say that it
      &quot;exhibits a habit-formation process&quot;).” ~ R. Wicks

              Strategies for improving sentence clarity include using transitional words, properly
              placing subordinate clauses, and choosing action verbs over &apos;be&apos; verbs (e.g.
              is, are).

              Because we specialize in reducing complex topics into concise summaries that are
              digestible to the average user, Base encourages contributors to write in plain style.
              For example: opt for simple words like use rather than utilize.
