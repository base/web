# Snapshots

:::warning

Geth Archive Nodes are no longer supported. For Archive functionality, use Reth, which provides significantly better performance in Baseâ€™s high-throughput environment.

:::

If you're a prospective or current Base Node operator and would like to restore from a snapshot to save time on the initial sync, it's possible to always get the latest available snapshot of the Base chain on mainnet and/or testnet by using the following CLI commands. The snapshots are updated every week.

#### Restoring from snapshot

In the home directory of your Base Node, create a folder named `geth-data` or `reth-data`. If you already have this folder, remove it to clear the existing state and then recreate it. Next, run the following code and wait for the operation to complete.

| Network | Client | Snapshot Type | Command                                                                                                               |
| ------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Testnet | Geth   | Full          | `wget https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`                 |
| Testnet | Reth   | Archive       | `wget https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |
| Mainnet | Geth   | Full          | `wget https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`                 |
| Mainnet | Reth   | Archive       | `wget https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |

You'll then need to untar the downloaded snapshot and place the `geth` subfolder inside of it in the `geth-data` folder you created (unless you changed the location of your data directory).

Return to the root of your Base node folder and start your node.

```bash [Terminal]
cd ..
docker compose up --build
```

Your node should begin syncing from the last block in the snapshot.

Check the latest block to make sure you're syncing from the snapshot and that it restored correctly. If so, you can remove the snapshot archive that you downloaded.
