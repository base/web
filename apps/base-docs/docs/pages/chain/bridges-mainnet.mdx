# Bridges

While the bridge on bridge.base.org has been deprecated, there are many bridges
that support moving assets between Base and other chains.

For questions, see our [FAQ](#faq).

## Superbridge

Superbridge enables you to bridge ETH and other supported assets from Ethereum mainnet (L1) directly to Base.

#### Supported Networks

- [Base Mainnet](https://superbridge.app/base)
- [Base Sepolia (Testnet)](https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia)

Want to see how Universal Bridge works? Check it out under the hood

```jsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { PayEmbed } from "thirdweb/react";

import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "....",
});

function Example() {
  return (
    <PayEmbed
      client={client}
      payOptions={{
        mode: "fund_wallet",
        prefillBuy: {
          chain: base,
          amount: "0.01",
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}

```

## Brid.gg

Brid.gg is another option that also helps you bridge ETH and supported assets between Ethereum mainnet (L1) and Base.

## Programmatic Bridging

See the [sample code repository](https://github.com/base-org/guides/tree/main/bridge/native) to see how to bridge ETH and ERC-20s from Ethereum to Base.

:::caution

**Double check the token address for ERC-20s** You can use any ERC-20 that is
supported on the network. You can check what assets are on Base and the
corresponding contract address via [this hub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data).
Ensure there is an address for `base`, [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/WETH/data.json#L16-L18).
Always test with small amounts to ensure the system is working as expected.

:::

:::caution
This implementation only can bridge assets to Base. Do not attempt to alter the
code to withdraw the assets.

<details>
<summary>**Why has Base deprecated the bridge on bridge.base.org?**</summary>

Base is committed to decentralization and the Superchain vision. Leveraging the community to bootstrap the Superchain bridges is a step in that direction; increasing censorship resistance and decentralization.
