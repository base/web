# Oracles

## Api3

Api3 delivers first-party oracles that pay you.
By connecting real-world data providers directly to smart contracts, ApiPI3 eliminates intermediaries, ensuring unmatched transparency and security. With pioneering mechanisms to recapture Oracle Extractable Value (OEV), Api3 empowers dApps with reliable data while minimizing and reclaiming the value they would otherwise leak to external actors. Api3 is redefining the oracle space by elevating oracles from mere data providers to entities that help builders retain the value they create.
Explore the [Api3 Market](https://market.api3.org/base) and start earning.

Check out our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.api3.org/dapps) for in-depth guides, references, and integration examples.

## Pyth

The [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) is one of the largest first-party Oracle network, delivering real-time data across [a vast number of chains](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses). Pyth introduces an innovative low-latency [pull oracle design](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand), where users can pull price updates onchain when needed, enabling everyone in the onchain environment to access that data point most efficiently. Pyth network updates the prices every **400ms**, making Pyth one of the fastest onchain oracles.

#### Pyth Price Feeds Features:

- 400ms latency
- Efficient and cost-effective Oracle
- [First-party](https://pyth.network/publishers) data sourced directly from financial institutions
- [Price feeds ranging from Crypto, Stock, FX, Metals](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids)
- [Available on all major chains](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses)

#### Supported Networks for Base (Pyth Price Feeds):

### Pyth Entropy
Pyth Entropy allows developers to quickly and easily generate secure **random numbers** onchain.

Check [how to generate random numbers in EVM contracts](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy/generate-random-numbers/evm) for a detailed walkthrough.

## Supra

[Supra](https://supraoracles.com) provides VRF and decentralized oracle price feeds that can be used for onchain and offchain use-cases such as spot and perpetual DEXes, lending protocols, and payments protocols. Supra’s oracle chain and consensus algorithm makes it one of the fastest-to-finality oracle providers, with layer-1 security guarantees. The pull oracle has a sub-second response time. Aside from speed and security, Supra’s rotating node architecture gathers data from 40+ data sources and applies a robust calculation methodology to get the most accurate value. The node provenance on the data dashboard also provides a fully transparent historical audit trail. Supra’s Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) paper was accepted into ICDCS 2023, the oldest distributed systems conference.

Visit the Supra [documentation](https://docs.supra.com/) to learn more about integrating Supra's oracle and VRF into your Base project.
