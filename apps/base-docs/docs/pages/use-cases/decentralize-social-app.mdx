# Onchain Social

Most of today's social apps follow the same formula: You sign in with an email, scroll a feed, and tap links that take you somewhere else.

But under the surface, your identity, content, and interactions are owned by the platform not by you. And if you want to build something new, you're building _on top of_ a platform, never _inside_ it.

**Onchain social flips that model.** It's a new paradigm where identity is user-owned, feeds are programmable, and apps exist directly inside the conversation.

- **Identity is portable and user-owned:** A Farcaster ID (FID) you control, not an account gated by a provider.
- **Apps are embedded, not linked out:** Rich, interactive experiences run natively inside posts, messages, or notifications.
- **Developers build inside the network:** Not on the sidelines, but as first-class citizens in the social graph.

This isn't about replacing platforms, it's about removing the walls between users, developers, and the experiences they create.

**Mini Apps: The Interface Layer for Onchain Social**

Mini Apps are lightweight, expressive web apps that live inside the social feed. They launch instantly from a cast or notification, feel native, and don't require logins or installs.

Think: polls, games, stores, chats all opening right inside the feed, personalised to you.

For users, that means seamless, interactive experiences that respond to your onchain identity. For builders, it means deploying directly into the conversation, not redirecting people away from it.

You're not building for the platform. You're building _inside_ it.

## Build with MiniKit

:::steps

### Install MiniKit

The fastest way to build a Mini App is with MiniKit, a developer toolkit that handles the hard parts for you.

```bash [Terminal]
npx create-onchain@alpha --mini
```

Or you can integrate MiniKit into an existing app by following the [installation guide](/builderkits/minikit/existing-app-integration).

In seconds, you get a working Mini App with:

- A full frontend \+ backend scaffold
- Built-in support for identity, notifications, and webhooks
- Native integrations with Base and OnchainKit

### Context: Apps That Know Where They Are

```tsx twoslash [App.tsx]
// @errors: 2305
import { useMiniKit } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit";

export default function App() {
  const { context } = useMiniKit();

  console.log(context?.user?.fid, context?.user?.displayName);
}
```

:::

Mini Apps don't just run in social feeds, they _understand_ where they were opened and by whom.

Using context from the Farcaster protocol, a Mini App knows whether it was launched from a cast, a channel, a user profile, or a notification and exactly which FID opened it.

That makes personalisation effortless and lets you build stateful, intelligent interactions without asking users to sign in.

## Next Steps

**Mini Apps Are Already Redefining What Social Can Be**

_You donâ€™t have to imagine it. You can build with it today._

With open identity, composable clients, and scalable infra, the next generation of social isn't just onchain it's **customisable, portable, and deeply interactive**.

If you've ever wanted to rethink how people connect online, now's your moment.
