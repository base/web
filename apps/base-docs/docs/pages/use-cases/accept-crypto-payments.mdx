## Objectives

By following this guide, you will learn how to:

- Create or configure a product in **Coinbase Commerce**
- Configure your **OnchainKit** environment
- Implement a checkout flow for accepting crypto payments
- Deploy and test your app to confirm the payment flow

## Prerequisites

### 1. Coinbase Commerce Account

[Coinbase Commerce](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/sign-up) allows you to accept cryptocurrency payments globally. Sign up to get started.

### 2. Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Account

[Coinbase Developer Platform](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud) (CDP) provides the tools and APIs you need for integration.

## Step-by-Step Setup

::::steps

### Step 1: Create a Product in Coinbase Commerce

1. **Log in** to your Coinbase Commerce account.
2. Go to the [product creation page](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/products).
3. **Add product details** (name, description, price).
4. Click **Create product**.
5. Once created, select **View product** and copy the **UUID** from the URL.

![Create product screenshot](/images/onchainkit-tutorials/pay-create-product-details.png)

**Tip**: Store the product UUID as an environment variable in your `.env` file. This makes it easier to reference safely in your code.

### Step 2: Clone the OnchainKit App Template

Use the official **OnchainKit app template** to bootstrap your project:

::::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create onchain@latest
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project. You'll be asked to provide a project name, add your CDP Client API key, and choose to share feedback with the OnchainKit team.

::::

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

In the project folder, open (or create) your `.env` file and add:

```bash [.env]
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID=
```

> **Note**:
>
> - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID` should be set to the **UUID** from your Coinbase Commerce product.
> - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY` should be your **CDP** API key.

### Step 4: Implement the Payment Component

1. **Open** `app/page.tsx` (or similar entry page).
2. **Import** the necessary components:

   ```typescript
   import { Checkout, CheckoutButton, CheckoutStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/checkout';
   import Image from 'next/image';

   const productId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID;
   ```

3. Create a folder to house the image of your product or service in `app/public`
4. **Add an image** of your product or service in the `public` folder (e.g., `app/public/my-pizza.jpeg`).
5. **Display** that image and conditionally render the checkout UI only when a wallet is connected:

   ```jsx [app/page.tsx]
   <section className='flex w-full flex-col items-center justify-center gap-8 px-2 py-4'>
            <h1 className='pixel-font text-xl md:text-2xl mb-8 text-center'>
              ONCHAIN PIZZA
            </h1>
            <div className='w-[300px] h-[300px] relative'>
              <Image
                src='/8bitpizza.png'
                fill
                style={{ objectFit: 'contain' }}
                alt='8-bit pizza'
                className='rounded-xl'
                priority
              />
            </div>
            <div className='mt-6'>
              {address ? (
                <Checkout productId={productId}>
                  <CheckoutButton coinbaseBranded={true} />
                  <CheckoutStatus />
                </Checkout>
              ) : (
                <Wallet>
                  <ConnectWallet>
                    <Avatar className='h-6 w-6' />
                    <Name />
                  </ConnectWallet>
                </Wallet>
              )}
            </div>
          </section>
   ```

:::tip
Use **conditional rendering** to avoid errors when no wallet address is detected.
:::

### Step 6: Test & Deploy

1. **Run** the development server:

::::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

::::

2. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000` to confirm that the payment button works for your product or service.
3. **Deploy** with your preferred hosting provider (e.g., Vercel).
