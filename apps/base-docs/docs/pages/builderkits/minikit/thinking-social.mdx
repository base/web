# Thinking Social

**Designing mini apps that people actually come back to.**

Most apps can launch. But few become part of someone’s daily rhythm.  
That’s usually not a product problem. It’s a people problem.

Social mini apps live or die based on how they make people feel: seen, connected, curious or like they belong. That’s not something you tack on — it’s something you build in from the start.

If you’re designing for feed-based platforms (like Warpcast, Threads, or anything with posts, reactions, and reply chains), this guide will help you:

- Challenge your idea early
- Apply the right social patterns (if it makes sense)
- Build for behaviors, not just features

## 1. Pressure-test your idea

Before you get into features or UI, take a step back. Ask whether your idea wants to be social — or if you’re forcing it. These prompts are designed to give you structured, clear feedback if you drop them into a LLM or use them in your own reflection.

**Prompt:**

```
Here’s a one-line description of my app: [insert idea].

Evaluate it across these questions:

1. Why would someone post here more than once?
2. Would the experience be better with another person involved?
3. What kind of content might naturally fill the feed over time?
4. What emotional reward might someone feel when they open it?

Please be direct. If the idea lacks natural social behavior, suggest ways it could evolve.

```

### 2. Identity Playgrounds

**The idea:** Give people ways to explore, express, or shape their identity within the app.

**Why it works:** People don’t just use feeds to consume — they use them to perform. Customization invites play, self-expression, and experimentation.

**Where it shows up:** Discord roles, Reddit flair, Tumblr themes.

**Use it for:** Differentiation, emotional investment, repeat posting.

**Prompt:**

```
Given my app idea: [insert idea], explore 2 ways users might express or explore identity.

For each, include:
– What the user customizes or signals
– How that shows up in the feed
– Why that might matter over time
```

### 3. Co-Creation Loops

**The idea:** Design behaviors that are better when shared — where users build on each other’s contributions.

**Why it works:** The strongest feeds don’t just display content; they build momentum. If one person’s post sparks another, you get a chain reaction.

**Where it shows up:** Remix threads, collab playlists, group journaling.

**Use it for:** Participation loops, content momentum, chain reactions.

**Prompt:**

```
How could users in [insert app idea] create something together or build on each other’s actions?
Return 3 co-creation flows that include:
– What kicks it off
– How others join in
– What the feed looks like after a few days

```

### 4. Long-Term Rituals

**The idea:** Introduce regular, shared behaviors that become a rhythm.

**Why it works:** Rituals create predictability, belonging, and anticipation. They give users a reason to come back on a schedule.

**Where it shows up:** Wordle scores, Monday memes, Friday drops, yearly Spotify Wrapped.

**Use it for:** Habit loops, appointment-based engagement, social cohesion.

**Prompt:**

```
Design 2 recurring rituals for [insert app idea].

For each, include:
– Frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
– What users post
– What emotion or payoff they get
– How it could spread through the feed

```

## Closing note

The mini apps that thrive aren’t the most complex — they’re the ones that understand how people connect.

**Remember:**

- Social features only work when they reflect real human behavior
- A feed isn’t just content — it’s a shared ritual
- True engagement comes from meaning over mechanics

As you build, ask: _Why would someone want to come back? Why would they share this with a friend?_ Those answers matter more than any feature list.

The best apps don’t just fill feeds. They create places people want to return to.  
So — what will your app make people feel?
