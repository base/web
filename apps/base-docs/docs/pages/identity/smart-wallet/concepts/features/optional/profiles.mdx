# Profiles

Profiles allow developers to request personal information from Smart Wallet users during a transaction. This is useful for applications that need:

- Email addresses for notifications or account creation
- Physical addresses for shipping products
- Phone numbers for verification
- Names for personalization

Smart Wallet handles the collection of this information and it is left to the developer
to validate it and store it as they see fit while following the standards and regulations in place.
Users can choose to use profile info (securely stored with Coinbase) or enter new information when asked for it.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    alt="Profiles Demo"
    src="/images/smart-wallet/ProfilesDemo.gif"
    width="1000"
    loading="lazy"
    style={{ borderRadius: "16px" }}
  />

</div>

<Callout type="info">
**Privacy First**

Users always have full control over their data. They can choose to share or withhold any information, and they're clearly shown what data you're requesting.

</Callout>

## How it works

When you send a request for a transaction to Smart Wallet,
you can specify the information you need from the user.

```ts
const response = await provider?.request({
        method: "wallet_sendCalls",
        params: [
          {
            version: "1.0",
            chainId: numberToHex(84532), // Base Sepolia testnet
            calls: [
              {
                to: "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e", // USDC contract address on Base Sepolia
                data: encodeFunctionData({
                  abi: erc20Abi,
                  functionName: "transfer",
                  args: [
                    "0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045",
                    parseUnits("0.01", 6),
                  ],
                }),
              },
            ], // Simple transfer of 0.01 USDC to the contract
            capabilities: {
              dataCallback: {
                requests: [
                  {
                    type: "email",
                    optional: false,
                  },
                  {
                    type: "physicalAddress",
                    optional: false,
                  },
                ],
                callbackURL: YOUR_CALLBACK_URL, // eg. https://your-url.com/api/data-validation
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      });
```

This adds an additional step to the transaction where the user is prompted to share their email address and their physical address like so:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    alt="Profiles Demo"
    src="/images/smart-wallet/ProfilesScreenshot.png"
    width="300"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <em>Profiles Screenshot</em>
</div>

Once the user has shared their information, the callbackURL is called with the data.
The callbackURL is a route on your server that you define and is used to validate the data.

You are also able to update the request based on the response from the user.

## Start using Profiles
