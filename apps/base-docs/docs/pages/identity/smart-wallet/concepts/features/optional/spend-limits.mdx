# Spend Limits

Spend Limits enable third-party signers to spend assets (native and ERC-20 tokens) from users' wallets. Once granted, spend limits
allow you to move your users' assets without any further signatures, unlocking use cases like subscriptions & trading bots. The reduced signing friction
can also be leveraged to enhance UX for high-frequency use cases such as onchain games.

Differences between Spend Limits and ERC-20 permits:

- Spend Limits **supports all ERC-20 assets**, whereas permits only support ERC-20s that implement the permit standard
- Spend Limits **enable spending native tokens**
- Spend Limits offers granular **controls for recurrence**
- The logic that controls asset movements is **implemented in the user's wallet**, not the asset contract

## The `SpendPermission` details

A spend limit is defined by the following parameters

```solidity
struct SpendPermission {
    address account;
    address spender;
    address token;
    uint160 allowance;
    uint48 period;
    uint48 start;
    uint48 end;
    uint256 salt;
    bytes extraData;
}
```

Spend Limits are managed by a single manager contract, the `SpendLimitManager`, which tracks the approval/revocation
statuses of all limits and enforces accurate spending limits and accounting.

## Approving

A user approves a spend limit by signing an [ERC-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) typed object that contains
the spend limit properties. This signature and the corresponding spend limit details are then submitted to
`SpendPermissionManager.approveWithSignature` to approve the spend limit onchain.

## Revoking

Users can revoke permissions at any time by calling `SpendPermissionManager.revoke`. Revocations are onchain calls that can be
batched similar to other ERC-4337 transactions.

Spenders can call `SpendPermissionManager.revokeAsSpender` to revoke their own permissions without requiring user interaction.

Once a spend limit has been revoked, it can never be re-approved. Therefore, if a user wants to re-authorize a revoked spend limit,
the spender will need to generate a new spend limit that has a unique hash from the original spend limit.
If the parameters of the new spend limit are identical to the revoked limit, the `salt` field of the limit can be used to generate a unique hash.

## Cycle accounting

Spend Limits offers granular controls for recurrence (e.g. 10 USDC / month).
As the third-party signer spends user assets, the `SpendPermissionManager` contract tracks cumulative spend and enforces the per-period
allowance. If there are multiple periods defined during the valid lifespan of the spend limit, the cumulative usage resets to 0
at the beginning of the next period, allowing the spender to once again spend up to the allowance.

This behavior is parameterized by the `start`, `end`, `period` and `allowance` properties of the permission.

Note that spend limits can be used for non-recurring allowances, either indefinite or with expiry, by setting
a period duration that spans the entire range between start and end.
