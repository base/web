# What is Smart Wallet?

Smart Wallet is a multi-chain self-custodial cryptocurrency wallet.
It enables users to create an onchain account in seconds
with no app or extension required, thanks to its reliance on [Passkeys](https://passkeys.com).
It is often described as a more secure and user-friendly way to interact with onchain applications.

## What can you do with Smart Wallet?

Smart Wallet combines the best features of a wallet and an app specific account:

- [Use MagicSpend](/identity/smart-wallet/concepts/features/built-in/MagicSpend): Use Coinbase balances onchain;
- [Get Free Sponsored Transactions](/identity/smart-wallet/concepts/base-gasless-campaign): Use Paymaster to sponsor transactions and get qualified for up to $15k in gas credits;
- [Support Sub Accounts](/identity/smart-wallet/guides/sub-accounts): Improve user experience with embedded accounts controlled by their Smart Wallet,
  eliminating the need for users to sign a transaction for every onchain action.
