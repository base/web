# Validation and Opcode Rules

Due to the mechanics of Account Abstraction wallets, there are additional [validation rules](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7562) that are applied to UserOperation transactions and enforced offchain by the bundler responsible for fronting gas associated with the UserOperation.
These rules are designed to protect bundlers and other off-chain block builders from DoS attacks in which a bundler fronts gas for a UserOperation transaction that ultimately fails and thereby fails to reimburse the bundler.

> ⚠️ Violation of these rules will result in the UserOperation being rejected by the bundler during the simulation phase.

## Banned Opcodes

These validation rules include a set of Opcode rules that limit the set of opcodes that can be executed by the UserOperation. Blocked opcodes include:

- `ORIGIN` (`0x32`)
- `GASPRICE` (`0x3A`)
- `BLOCKHASH` (`0x40`)
- `COINBASE` (`0x41`)
- `TIMESTAMP` (`0x42`)
- `NUMBER` (`0x43`)
- `PREVRANDAO/DIFFICULTY` (`0x44`)
- `GASLIMIT` (`0x45`)
- `BASEFEE` (`0x48`)
- `BLOBHASH` (`0x49`)
- `BLOBBASEFEE` (`0x4A`)
- `CREATE` (`0xF0`)
- `INVALID` (`0xFE`)
- `SELFDESTRUCT` (`0xFF`)

> ℹ️ Note: `CREATE` is allowed in the "Contract Creation" and "Staked factory creation" sections.

For the complete specification of these rules, see [EIP-7562](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7562).
