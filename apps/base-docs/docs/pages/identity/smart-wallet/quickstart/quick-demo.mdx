# Quick Demo using OnchainKit (5 mins)

This option uses the OnchainKit [Wallet component](/builderkits/onchainkit/wallet/wallet). It is perfect for quickly experiencing Smart Wallet functionality with minimal setup.

<Callout type="info">
**What is OnchainKit?**

[OnchainKit](https://www.base.org/builders/onchainkit)
is a suite of components allowing you to build
your onchain app fast and quick. It is a
very popular solution to build on Base. You can learn more about it [here](/builderkits/onchainkit/getting-started).

## Step 1: Clone the Template Repository

Let's start by cloning the [repository](https://github.com/coinbase/onchain-app-template). Open a terminal and execute the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coinbase/onchain-app-template
cd onchain-app-template
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Before running your project, you need to set up your environment variables. Follow these steps:

### Get a ReOwn Project ID

1. Sign up to [ReOwn Cloud](https://www.reown.com/cloud)
2. Click on Create, and go through the steps (screenshot below):
   - Name your app (eg. OnchainKit-Template)
   - Select a product - Choose WalletKit
   - Select a platform - Choose JavaScript

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    alt="ReOwn Project ID"
    src="/images/smart-wallet/ReownSteps.png"
    width="1000"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <em>Screenshot of the steps to get your ReOwn Project ID</em>
</div>

### Get a Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Client API Key

1. Sign up to [Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP)](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/)
2. Create a new project and copy the [Client API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects/api-keys/client-key) (screenshot below)

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    alt="Coinbase Developer Platform Client API Key"
    src="/images/smart-wallet/CDPSteps.png"
    width="1000"
    loading="lazy"
  />
  <em>Coinbase Developer Platform Client API Key</em>
</div>

### Create your .env file

Now that you have obtained your ReOwn Project ID and CDP API Key, it is time to create the .env file:

1. Copy `.env.local.default` from to the repository root and name it `.env`
2. Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` as they are
3. Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID` with their respective values obtained from the previous steps

Congratulations! We are ready to run the application.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies and Run

Open your terminal, make sure you are at the directory `/onchain-app-template` and execute the following:

```bash
# Install packages
bun i

# Run Next app
bun run dev
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Make sure Bun is installed**

This example uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a preferred package manager. If you run into an error because you don't have Bun installed you can run the following command to install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

</Callout>

Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Step 4: Explore Smart Wallet Features

The template includes:

- Pre-integrated Wallet component
- OnchainKit components for blockchain interactions
- Basic authentication flow
- Transaction handling (NFT Mint)

This setup is ideal for:

- Beginners exploring onchain apps and Smart Wallet functionality
- Developers evaluating Smart Wallet capabilities
- Quick prototyping
