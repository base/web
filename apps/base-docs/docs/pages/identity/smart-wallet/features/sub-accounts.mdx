# Sub Accounts

Sub Accounts enable developers to create and manage app-specific accounts for their applications. These accounts are linked to the user's Smart Wallet and can be utilized to sign transactions specifically for the app. This integration grants developers full control over the user experience, ensuring a seamless and cohesive interaction within the app.

## Technical Details

- Smart Wallet Ownership: The user's Smart Wallet acts as an owner of the Sub Account, allowing it to manage assets on the Sub Account and make calls from it. 
- App-Signer Agnostic: Sub Accounts are designed to be agnostic to whatever signing software an app wants to use: whether in-browser CryptoKey or server signers from teams like Privy or Turnkey. 
- Sub Accounts can be used to sign transactions, messages, and EIP-712 typed data.
