# How to Contribute to Docs

This guide is intended for all contributors who are adding new features, content, or making updates to the Smart Wallet documentation.
Following these guidelines ensures consistency and maintains
the documentation structure, making it easier for developers to find information.

## Documentation Structure Guidelines

### Core Principle: Maintain Existing Structure

The Smart Wallet documentation is organized into the following main sections:

1. **Quickstart**
2. **Concepts**
3. **Guides**
4. **Examples**
5. **Technical Reference**
6. **Contribute**

<Callout type="warning">
  **Avoid creating new top-level sections at all costs**
  
  All new content must fit within these existing sections.

</Callout>

### Section Purpose and Content Placement

When adding new content, determine the appropriate section based on the following criteria:

#### Quickstart

- End-to-end guides for getting developers up and running quickly
- Should remain focused and concise
- Update only when there are fundamental changes to the initial setup process

#### Concepts

- Explanatory content about Smart Wallet components, architecture, and design philosophy
- Add new concept documentation when introducing fundamentally new capabilities or paradigms
- Subsections include:
  - Intro
  - Built-in Features
  - Optional Features
  - Additional conceptual topics as needed

#### Guides

- Step-by-step tutorials for specific tasks and implementation scenarios
- **All guides should live under the main "Guides" section**
- Avoid creating deep hierarchical subsections
- Name guides clearly with action-oriented titles (e.g., "Implementing Multi-Signature Verification" rather than "Multi-Sig Guide")

#### Examples

- Complete, working code examples demonstrating real-world use cases
- Each example should be self-contained and fully functional
- Include comments explaining key implementation details
- Examples should cover different application domains (SocialFi, DeFi, consumer applications)

#### Technical Reference

- Comprehensive technical documentation of APIs, methods, components, and configurations
- Structured reference material rather than tutorial content
- Include parameter descriptions, return values, and usage examples
- All technical specifications for new features go here, not in separate sections

#### Contribute

- Information for contributors to the Smart Wallet project
- Update when contribution processes change

## Avoiding Subsection Proliferation

- **For Guides**: Keep all guides at the same level under the Guides section
- **For Technical Reference**: Organize by component or feature, not by use case
- When tempted to add a new subsection, consider if the content could be reorganized to fit existing sections
- Use cross-referencing between related content rather than creating new organizational structures

## Documentation Style Guidelines

### Writing Style

1. **Be concise**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid unnecessary words.
2. **Use active voice**: Write "The function returns a value" instead of "A value is returned by the function."
3. **Developer-focused**: Assume the reader is a developer with basic knowledge of blockchain concepts.
4. **Task-oriented**: Focus on helping the reader accomplish specific tasks.
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout documentation.

### Formatting

1. **Markdown usage**:

   - Use proper heading hierarchy (# for main titles, ## for section headings, etc.)
   - Use code blocks with language specification (```javascript)
   - Use tables for parameter references
   - Use bulleted lists for steps or options

2. **Code examples**:
   - Include complete, working code examples
   - Comment code thoroughly
   - Follow the project's coding style guide

### Abbreviations and Terminology

1. **First reference**: The first time you use an abbreviation or technical term, spell it out followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. Example: "Account Abstraction (AA)"
2. **Consistency**: Use the same term for the same concept throughout the documentation
3. **Glossary reference**: Consider adding new terms to a glossary section within Technical Reference

### Common Abbreviations Standardization

- Smart Wallet - SW (only after first use)
- Account Abstraction - AA
- Decentralized Finance - DeFi
- ERC-4337 - No abbreviation needed, use as is
- Ethereum Virtual Machine - EVM

## Documentation Update Process

### For New Features

1. **Identify affected sections**: Determine which of the existing sections need updating
2. **Update conceptual information**: Add explanations to the Concepts section
3. **Create practical guides**: Add step-by-step tutorials to the Guides section
4. **Document API details**: Add technical specifications to the Technical Reference section
5. **Add examples**: Create working examples in the Examples section
6. **Cross-reference**: Ensure new content links to related existing content

### For Content Improvements

1. **Respect the structure**: Work within the existing structure
2. **Focus on clarity**: Improve explanations without adding unnecessary detail
3. **Consolidate where possible**: Combine related guides rather than creating new ones
4. **Remove outdated content**: Delete or update deprecated information

## Review Checklist Before Submission
