# Coin Your Bangers: Turn Your Jokes into Coins

In this guide we illustrate how to use Smart Wallet and Zora's content coin SDK to create an engaging consumer application with great UX.

Memecoins and culturecoins have been catalysts of the onchain economy, allowing people to rally around concepts that are fun and engaging with a potential upside.

Memecoins are great for long term community and culture building onchain.
Contentcoins are an emergent category of coins focused on valuing individual pieces of content and providing monetization for creators.

Apps like [Zora](https://zora.co/) or [Flaunch](https://flaunch.gg/) illustrate the power of contentcoins.
They create a new category of apps that we may call "contentcoin apps".

## Overview

This example explains "Coin Your Bangers", a full onchain app that lets users turn their jokes into coins on Base.

Through this example, you can learn how to:

- Use Wagmi to initialize an onchain app
- Use Smart Wallet to sign in users
- Use [Sub Accounts](/identity/smart-wallet/concepts/features/optional/sub-accounts) for a better user experience
- Use [Zora SDK](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/create-coin) to create a new coin
- Use OpenAI to generate coin metadata

The full codebase of this app is available on Github:

## Why use Smart Wallet and Sub Accounts to build your onchain app?

Onboarding users to consumer onchain apps has always been a challenge, mainly
due to the need for a wallet and the pop-up experience.
In the case of web apps, this has always come in the form of
a browser extension that users need to install and an annoying pop-up experience for every onchain action.
In order to solve this, Smart Wallet and Sub-Accounts were created.

Smart Wallet is a new way to universally sign in into any onchain app.

Sub-Accounts are a new way to interact with onchain apps in a more user friendly way.

✨ **No more pop-ups, no more browser extensions, no more onboarding friction.** ✨

**Does Zora use Smart Wallet?**

Yes, Zora integrates Smart Wallet smart contracts directly into their protocol.
This allows users to sign in to the app and create contentcoins without any additional steps.

You can see the share of Zora from Smart Wallet transactions on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/wilsoncusack/coinbase-smart-wallet-kpis).

## Run the app

1. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash [Terminal]
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/base/demos.git

# Navigate to the app
cd demos/smart-wallet/coin-your-joke

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy the environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open the repository in your favorite editor (eg. Cursor, VSCode, etc.) and edit the `.env` file with your own values as specified in the [README](https://github.com/base/demos/blob/master/smart-wallet/coin-your-joke/README.md).

```
ENV=local or prod
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=your_deployment_url (http://localhost:3000 for local development)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

3. Run the app

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

## Key Components

### Wagmi Config (`wagmi.ts`)

The wagmi config is used to set up the Smart Wallet client.

```ts
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { http, cookieStorage, createConfig, createStorage } from "wagmi";
import { baseSepolia } from "wagmi/chains";
import { coinbaseWallet } from "wagmi/connectors";
import { toHex } from "viem";

export const cbWalletConnector = coinbaseWallet({
  appName: "Coin Your Bangers",
  preference: {
    keysUrl: "https://keys-dev.coinbase.com/connect",
    options: "smartWalletOnly",
  },
  subAccounts: {
    enableAutoSubAccounts: true,
    defaultSpendLimits: {
      84532: [ // Base Sepolia Chain ID
        {
          token: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
          allowance: toHex(parseEther('0.01')), // 0.01 ETH
          period: 86400, // 24h
        },
      ],
    },
  },
});

export function getConfig() {
  return createConfig({
    chains: [base, baseSepolia],
    connectors: [cbWalletConnector],
    // ... other config options
  });
}

// ... other wagmi config options
```

As you can see, we are using the `subAccounts` option to enable auto sub-accounts
for the `cbWalletConnector` (Smart Wallet Wagmi connector).

As it's broken down in the [Sub Accounts](/identity/smart-wallet/guides/sub-accounts/setup) guide,
the key preference parameters are:

- `keysUrl`: Points to the development environment for Smart Wallet testing
- `options: 'smartWalletOnly'`: Ensures only Smart Wallet mode is used
- `enableAutoSubAccounts: true`: When set to true, automatically creates a Sub Account at connection
- `defaultSpendLimits`: Configures Spend Limits for Sub Account for a network (eg. Base Sepolia `84532`), including:

  - Token address (In this case, `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` represents the native ETH)
  - Allowance WEI amount (in Hex)
  - Time period for the allowance (in seconds, e.g., 86400 for 24 hours)

### CoinButton Component (`CoinButton.tsx`)

The deployment button component handles the actual token creation:

```tsx
export function CoinButton({
  name,
  symbol,
  uri,
  initialPurchaseWei = BigInt(0),
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  className
}: CreateCoinArgs) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

Key components:

- Using Zora's [`createCoin`](https://docs.zora.co/coins/sdk/create-coin) function to create a new coin
- Using Smart Wallet and Wagmi to submit the transaction
- Loading states and error handling
- Transaction status tracking

### Metadata Generation API

The API endpoint uses OpenAI to generate creative coin metadata:

```typescript
// Example API structure
async function generateMetadata(joke: string) {
  // 1. Process the joke using OpenAI
  // 2. Generate coin name and symbol
  // 3. Create metadata JSON
  // 4. Return coin parameters
}
```

Key components:

- OpenAI integration for creative naming
- Metadata JSON generation
- URI creation for token metadata
- Error handling and validation

## Deployment

You can deploy your app to Vercel by following the instructions [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments).

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to build a full-featured onchain application that combines:

- Smart Wallet for Sign In
- Sub Accounts for a better user experience
- OpenAI for metadata generation
- Zora's SDK for coin creation
- Wagmi for onchain integration
- Error handling
- Transaction management

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend or modify for other use cases beyond joke tokenization.
