## Basenames

### I already have a basename but it isn't showing up/ I don't have the option to transfer it.

A wallet can use multiple basenames. Sign up with a new basename, then transfer your existing basename to this new wallet. Here are the steps to transfer and use your existing basename.

1. [Transfer the basename between wallets](https://docs.base.org/identity/basenames/basenames-faq#10-how-do-i-transfer-my-basename-to-another-address).
2. [Set the basename as the primary name on your new wallet.](https://docs.base.org/identity/basenames/basenames-faq#9-how-do-i-set-my-basename-as-my-primary-name-for-my-address)

### Will my basename show up on Farcaster?

No, your basename will only be visible from users in the Coinbase Wallet beta. Interaction from other clients will display your Farcaster username

## Wallet and Funds

### I logged into the beta, but don't see my funds from Coinbase Wallet.

The Coinbase Wallet beta currently only supports smart wallets. Your funds are safe and still in Coinbase Wallet. If you created a new smart wallet during the onboarding process, then your previous Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet will only be available in the standard Coinbase Wallet app.

You can return to your previous wallet by toggling beta mode off.
Navigate to the Social tab (first icon), tap your profile pic, and toggle "beta mode" off.

### What is a smart wallet?

A smart wallet is a passkey-secured, self-custodial onchain wallet that's embedded in the app. It's designed for easy onboarding and better user experience. No browser extensions, no app switching.

If you don't have a smart wallet, you will create one in the onboarding flow for the new beta app.

### I have Coinbase Wallet, but how do I know if I have a smart wallet?

If you use a passkey to sign onchain transactions, you have a smart wallet. If you don't know or you have a 12 word recovery phrase backed up somewhere, you use an EOA (externally owned account), not a smart wallet.

From the in-app browser, go to wallet.coinbase.com and log in. If you have a smart wallet, you'll see it say "smart wallet" in your account details.

You'll be asked to create or import a smart wallet on the way into the beta. If you are uncertain, create a new wallet.

### Do I need a smart wallet for the beta?

Yes. The beta is smart wallet only

## Farcaster Integration

### How do I connect my Farcaster account?

Open the social tab and engage with any post (tap like or recast). You'll be prompted to open the Farcaster app to connect your account. Follow the prompts to link Coinbase Wallet to Farcaster.

### What if I don't have a Farcaster account?

Coinbase Wallet currently does not yet support new Farcaster account creation. If you do not have a Farcaster account, you will need to go to the app store and download Farcaster to sign up for an account. Then follow the "How do I connect my Farcaster account" instructions above to link your accounts.

## Beta Management

### How can I toggle the beta off in Coinbase Wallet again?

Navigate to the Social tab (first icon), tap your profile photo, and toggle "beta mode" off.

### I toggled beta mode off - how do I rejoin?

Navigate to the Assets tab (last tab on the right), select the settings icon in the upper right, and toggle "Beta mode".

### I needed to reinstall Coinbase Wallet and no longer have access to the beta - can I get another invite?

Unfortunately, our invites are one time use. If you uninstall the app, we aren't able to add you back into the beta. However, all your wallets will still be available as long as you have your passkeys, backups, and recovery phrases.

## Launch Timeline

### When will the official app launch?

We will announce the official app launch date soon - thanks for being a part of the beta!
