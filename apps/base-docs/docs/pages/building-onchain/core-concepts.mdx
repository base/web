## **Core Concepts**

Building onchain means tapping into a global, fast, and cheap payment network, plus a thriving ecosystem of NFTs, games, social networks, and more. This section will introduce the **unique aspects** of building onchain and show you **how Base’s tools** (e.g., OnchainKit, Paymaster, Smart Wallet, etc.) simplify that process.

If you’d like to learn more about the broader vision and benefits, check out Why Base. If you want to **start building right away**, visit our Quickstart.
