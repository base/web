### AI Onchain

AI agents are quickly evolving, but most can’t hold or manage economic value on their own. AgentKit bridges that gap by giving AI agents a wallet and “economic agency,” letting them deploy contracts, create tokens, or manage funds autonomously on Base. In this final sub-section, you’ll learn about practical use cases for combining AI with onchain functionality—and how AgentKit simplifies the process.

- **AI + Blockchain**
  - AI agents can read the web, but they typically can’t manage crypto or execute onchain tasks.
- **AgentKit**
  - Gives AI agents “economic agency” by integrating them with onchain wallets, letting them deploy contracts, transfer tokens, and carry out tasks on Base autonomously.
  - Bridge AI (LLMs) with crypto in a secure, straightforward way.
