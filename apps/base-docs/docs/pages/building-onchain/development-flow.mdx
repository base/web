## The Development Flow

## Client-side Development

If you're focusing on the front end or building a user interface, Kits like OnchainKit provide an opinionated, model-agnostic setup for handling user authentication, contract interactions, and transaction status updates. With a client-side approach:

1. **Set up an RPC endpoint** to read chain data.
2. **Use OnchainKit** (or an equivalent framework) to handle function calls, sign messages, or sponsor gas if you've integrated Paymaster solutions.
3. **Incorporate Identity Solutions** like Basenames or Onchain Profiles for more user-friendly experiences.

## Smart Contract Development

Base is an EVM-equivalent chain, so you can build or reuse your smart contracts written in Solidity. Typical steps include:

1. **Choose a development environment** such as Hardhat or Foundry.
2. **Write and compile your contracts** in Solidity.
3. **Test locally** or on a testnet before pushing to mainnet.
4. **Deploy to Base** using your EOA wallet (or specialized deployment tooling).

Smart wallets, Paymaster services, and other infrastructure components on Base can significantly streamline the user experience around your onchain programs.

## Developer Environments

Base offers multiple environments to help you iterate quickly:

- **Mainnet**: Production environment, where real-value transactions occur.
- **Testnets (e.g., Base testnet on Sepolia)**: Great for QA or staging.
- **Local Development**: You can run a local EVM environment with Hardhat or similar tools to test your contracts before deploying.
