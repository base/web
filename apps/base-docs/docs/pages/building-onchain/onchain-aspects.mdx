## **Unique Aspects of Building Onchain (and the Tools That Help)**

Building applications onchain adds a unique layer of logic and data accessibility that you don’t encounter in standard offchain stacks. While you can still maintain a traditional backend and database, certain features—such as user accounts, identity, payment flows, and data verification—change when they’re executed onchain. In the following sub-sections, we’ll explore these differences one by one, see why they matter, and learn about the tools (like Base’s Smart Wallet, Paymaster, OnchainKit, etc.) that simplify each aspect.
