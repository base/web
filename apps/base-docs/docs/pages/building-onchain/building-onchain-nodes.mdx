### **3.4 Interacting with the Chain (Node Access)**

Every time you read or write data on Base, you’re making calls to a blockchain node via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) endpoints. You can host your own node or rely on a service like Base Node (via CDP). This sub-section explains why node access is crucial, compares self-hosted vs. hosted node options, and shows you how to integrate an RPC endpoint in your application for stable, scalable onchain interactions.

- **Why You Need a Node**
  - Under the hood, apps read/write onchain data by making RPC calls to a blockchain node.
  - You can self-host or use a managed service.
- **Base Node** (via CDP)
  - High-throughput, free tier available, plus enterprise-grade options.
  - You’ll typically connect via `https://...` or `wss://...` endpoints for reading balances, sending transactions, etc.
