### Paying for Onchain Transactions (Gas)

Transactions on blockchain networks typically require “gas” fees, which can be a major hurdle for new users without pre-funded wallets. Paymaster services address this by letting developers sponsor gas or allowing users to pay fees in tokens other than ETH. In this sub-section, we explore how Paymaster works on Base, how it improves user onboarding, and how you can implement it in your own application.

- **What’s the Challenge?**
  - Users must have gas tokens (ETH on Base) to pay fees.
  - This can be a hurdle for newcomers who have zero crypto.
- **Paymaster**
  - A service that sponsors gas fees on behalf of users (gasless transactions).
  - Allows your users to transact without needing ETH in their wallet, or to pay gas in alternative tokens like USDC.
  - Base’s [Paymaster solution] (via CDP) streamlines onboarding and can significantly improve user experience.
