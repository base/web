### **3.7 Onchain Social Networks**

Traditional social media apps must build their user bases from scratch and can risk losing access to platform APIs. In contrast, onchain social networks (e.g., Farcaster) allow your app to tap into existing social graphs and user relationships immediately. This part covers how open social protocols foster collaboration, prevent centralized gatekeeping, and eliminate the “empty network” problem for new social apps.

- **Open Social Layers** (e.g., Farcaster)
  - Rather than building siloed social graphs from scratch, you can tap into existing onchain social networks.
  - If your user is on Farcaster, your app automatically gains access to their followers, social feed, etc.
  - This solves the classic “empty network” problem, providing content and user relationships from day one.
