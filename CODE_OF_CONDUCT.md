# Code of Conduct for base/web

## 1. Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines expectations for all community participants and the consequences of unacceptable behavior. Our goal is to create a safe, inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

- Show empathy and kindness towards other community members.
- Avoid using offensive or derogatory language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on what is best for the community as a whole.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated and includes:

- Harassment or discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.
- Use of derogatory, discriminatory, or explicit language.
- Personal attacks or intimidation.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—report it by opening a support ticket in the [Base Discord](https://base.org/discord). All reports will be handled with discretion.

## 5. Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including project owners and maintainers, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior must comply immediately.
If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take action they deem appropriate, including a temporary suspension or permanent removal from the community, without prior warning.

## 6. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual represents the project or community in public spaces.

## 7. Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
